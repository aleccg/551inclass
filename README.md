## Connecting to JuliaBox
1. Visit [juliabox.org][1].
2. Select the **Sync** tab at the top of the page.
3. Paste https://github.com/kersulis/551-in-class into the **Git Clone URL** field.
4. Leaving the **Branch** and **JuliaBox Folder** fields with their default values, click **+** to load the repository into a folder named `551-in-class`.
5. Now click on the **IJulia** tab at the top of the page. If you don't see a new folder called `551-in-class`, refresh your browser (don't worry, no files will be lost).
6. Enter the `551-in-class` folder and the `1-background-subtract` sub-folder, and click the notebook to open it in a new tab. The notebook is editable, and any Julia code cell should execute and show appropriate output.

Any notebook changes you make will be saved on your own computer -- they will have no effect on the repository.
