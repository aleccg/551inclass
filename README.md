_IJulia notebooks for EECS 453/551_

## Connecting to JuliaBox
1. Visit [juliabox.org][1].
2. Select the **Sync** tab at the top of the page.
3. Paste https://github.com/kersulis/551inclass into the **Git Clone URL** field.
4. Leaving the **Branch** field alone, enter "551inclass" into the **JuliaBox Folder** field, then click **+** to load the repository into a folder named `551inclass`.
5. Now click on the **IJulia** tab at the top of the page. If you don't see a new folder called `551inclass`, refresh your browser (don't worry, no files will be lost).
6. Enter the `551inclass` folder and the `1-background-subtract` sub-folder, and click the notebook to open it in a new tab. The notebook is editable, and any Julia code cell should execute and show appropriate output.

Any notebook changes you make will be saved on your JuliaBox account--they will have no effect on the repository.
